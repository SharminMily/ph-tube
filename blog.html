            <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl text-blue-600 pb-6">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
            <p class="text-lg pb-4">
                var, let, and const are three different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, each with its own
                scope. <br>
                Here's an overview of the scope of each:
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="flex flex-col w-full lg:flex-row">

                    <div class="grid flex-grow h-full p-6 card bg-base-300 rounded-box place-items-center">
                        <div>
                            <p class="font-bold text-xl">1. var:</p>
                            <li>Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, but they are not
                                block-scoped.</li>
                            <li>If declared outside any function, they become global variables accessible from anywhere
                                in
                                the script</li>
                            <li>Hoisting: var variables are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope, which
                                means you can access them before they are actually declared in the code.</li>
                        </div>

                            <li>let variables are not hoisted to the top of the block, so you can only access them after
                                they have been declared.</li>
                            <li>If declared within a function, they are only accessible within that function.</li>
                            <li>If declared outside a function, they have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere
                                in the script.</li>
                        </div>

                            <li>Variables declared with const are also block-scoped like let.</li>
                            <li>Like let, const variables are not hoisted and must be declared before they can be used.
                            </li>
                            <li>const variables are often used to represent values that are not expected to change,
                                improving code readability and preventing accidental reassignments.</li>
                            <li>Variables declared with const are also block-scoped like let.</li>

            <p class="text-lg pb-4">
                null and undefined are two distinct values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a value. <br>
                Let's explore the use cases of both:
            </p>


            <div class="flex flex-col w-full lg:flex-row">

                <div class="grid flex-grow h-full p-6 card bg-base-300 rounded-box place-items-center">
                    <div>
                        <p class="font-bold text-xl">1. null:</p>
                        <li>The null value is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
                        <li>It is often used to indicate that a variable should be empty or have no value.</li>
                        <li>Use cases include scenarios where you want to reset a variable or indicate that an
                            object property has no value.</li>
                        <p class="font-bold">Example: <br>
                            let user = null;
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="divider lg:divider-horizontal">OR</div>
                <div class="grid flex-grow h-full p-6 card bg-base-300 rounded-box place-items-center">
                    <div>
                        <p class="font-bold text-xl">2.undefined:</p>
                        <li>The undefined value is used to represent the absence of any assigned value. <br> It is often
                            the default value of variables that have been declared but not explicitly assigned.</li>
                        <li>Functions that do not explicitly return a value also implicitly return undefined.</li>
                        <li>Use cases include checking if a variable has been assigned a value or not, and also when
                            a function doesn't return anything.</li>
                        <p class="font-bold">Example: <br>
                            let x;
                            function foo() {
                            }

        <section class="mt-8">
            <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl text-blue-600 pb-6">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p class="text-lg pb-4">
                REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked
                applications, particularly web services. A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of
                guidelines and conventions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other
                over the internet using the principles of REST.
                  <br>
                Key characteristics of a REST API include:
               
                    <li>Resources: REST APIs model data and functionality as resources, which can be thought of as objects or entities. Each resource is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).</li>
                    <li>Resources: REST APIs model data and functionality as resources, which can be thought of as objects or entities. Each resource is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).GET,POST,PUT,DELETE</li>
                    <li>Stateless: Each client request to a REST API should contain all the information needed to process the request. The server doesn't maintain any client state between requests.</li>
                    <li>Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a consistent and uniform way of interacting with resources</li>
                    <li>Representation: Resources in a REST API are represented in different formats, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML. Clients and servers can negotiate the appropriate representation format based on the Accept and Content-Type headers.</li>
                    <li>Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): This principle encourages including hyperlinks (URLs) in API responses, allowing clients to discover and navigate to related resources without needing prior knowledge of the API structure.</li>
